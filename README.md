# Cat_Accelerometry
Buiding predictive models to predict cat behaviour using accelerometers

# Step 1: Data collection
For this study, two accelerometers were attached to domestic cats:
- Ventrally attached to a collar
- Attached to a harness, with the activity monitor resting on the left shoulder blade



ActiGraph wGT3X-BT accelerometers were used.

# [Step 2: Feature Engineering](https://github.com/MSmit1992/Cat_Accelerometry/tree/main/Step%202:%20Feature%20engineering)
Acceleration data was sampled at a frequency of 30 Hz (raw data). A total of 35 predictor variabes were derived from the raw x,y,z data and summarized into 1 second epochs.
