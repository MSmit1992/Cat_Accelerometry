# Cat_Accelerometry
Buiding predictive models to predict cat behaviour using accelerometers

# Step 1: Data collection
For this study, two accelerometers were attached to domestic cats:
- Ventrally attached to a collar
- Attachec to a harness, with the activity monitor resting on the left shoulder blade

ActiGraph wGT3X-BT accelerometers were used.
