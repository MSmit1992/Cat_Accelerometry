# Cat_Accelerometry
Buiding predictive models to predict cat behaviour using accelerometers

# Step 1: Data collection
For this study, two accelerometers were attached to domestic cats:
- Ventrally attached to a collar
- Attached to a harness, with the activity monitor resting on the left shoulder blade

While wearing the accelerometers, cats were videorecorded. Videorecordings were used to score the behaviour of cats.

ActiGraph wGT3X-BT accelerometers were used.

# [Step 2: Feature Engineering](https://github.com/MSmit1992/Cat_Accelerometry/tree/main/Step%202:%20Feature%20engineering)
Acceleration data was sampled at a frequency of 30 Hz (raw data). A total of 35 predictor variabes were derived from the raw x,y,z data and summarized into 1 second epochs.

# [Step 3: Merge accelerometer and annoted datasets](https://github.com/MSmit1992/Cat_Accelerometry/tree/main/Step%203:%20Merge%20datasets)
Following step 2, you now have a file for each cat containing the 35 predictor variables. The next step is to merge this data with scored behaviour (annotated) data.

# [Step 4: Prepare datasets](https://github.com/MSmit1992/Cat_Accelerometry/tree/main/Step%204:%20Prepare%20datasets)


# [Step 5: Build predictive models](https://github.com/MSmit1992/Cat_Accelerometry/tree/main/Step%205:%20Build%20models)
