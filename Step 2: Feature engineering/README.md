- The R code used to derive the predictor variables (FeatureEngineering.R).

The excel files containing the raw accelerometer data for each cat are to big to be uploaded.

# Feature engineering
Acceleration data was sampled at a frequency of 30 Hz (raw data). A total of 35 predictor variabes were derived from the raw x,y,z accelerometer data and summarized into 1 second epochs
